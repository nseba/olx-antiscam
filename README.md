There are apparently a lot of fraud attempts on OLX. The "buyers" will contact you asking details about the product you are sending and finally telling you that they want to buy it. They tell you that they want to use the OLX payment and shipping and they will send a link to you where they ask for card details (card number, exp. date, CVV and amount of money on card). 

DO NOT fill in your data there!

Instead, use this little fun tool to send them 10000 (or whatever number you want) invalid card numbers. The algorithm ensures the card numbers are invalid so no risk there.
